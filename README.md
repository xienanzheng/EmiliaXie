Great! Here’s how to deploy your Telegram bot on Render:

Step 1: Set Up Your Web Service
Log In:

Go to Render and log in to your account.
Create a New Web Service:

On your dashboard, click New + and select Web Service.
Upload Your Bot Code:

You can either:
Connect your GitHub repository if your code is hosted there.
Or, directly upload your code:
Create a .zip file containing your baby_tracker_bot.py file and any additional files like requirements.txt (explained below).
Upload the .zip file during the setup process.
Step 2: Configure Your Web Service
Set Environment Variables:

After uploading your code, go to the Environment tab.
Add a new variable:
Key: BOT_API_TOKEN
Value: Your token from BotFather (e.g., 7790382746:AAEhGPg2qoNnboGQsntZzNMcez6-YeL7LEs).
Specify the Start Command:

Set the start command to run your bot:
bash
Copy
Edit
python baby_tracker_bot.py
Step 3: Add Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file:

This file lists the Python libraries your bot needs to run. Use this content for your requirements.txt:
Copy
Edit
python-telegram-bot==20.0
apscheduler
sqlite3
Ensure the File Is Uploaded:

If uploading manually, include requirements.txt in your .zip file.
If using GitHub, ensure it is committed to your repository.
Step 4: Deploy the Bot
After configuring the service, click Create Web Service.
Render will build and deploy your bot.
Check the logs in the Render dashboard to ensure there are no errors.
Step 5: Test the Bot
Open Telegram and interact with your bot using its username.
Send commands like /start and /log_feed 150ml to confirm it’s working.
Keep the Bot Running
Render’s free tier will keep the bot online continuously. If you encounter any issues, check the logs for errors or let me know, and I’ll assist you further!
